# Artboard Plus

Artboard tools to speed up your Adobe XD workflow. Rearrange artboards into grid, sort them by name or create an artboard around selection.

## Rearange artboards into grid

Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Rearrange Artboards into Grid` to rearrange all artboards in the document. If you have selected artboards, it will rearrange only the selected ones.

This is where you set the horizontal and vertical spacing when rearranging artboards. **Due to Adobe XD incompatibility these settings can only be saved globally and not per document**
