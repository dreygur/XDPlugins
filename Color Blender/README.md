[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) plugin to blend fill colors across a set of selected objects. There are two ways to use this plugin:

* **Select two items** to create a series of clones with colors blended between them
* **Select more items** to apply the blend to existing objects - blending between the first & last item's colors (ignoring the rest)

The order of objects in the blend is determined by their z order.
